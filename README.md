# nand2testris
My implementations for the nan2tetris course (https://www.coursera.org/course/nand2tetris1 | http://nand2tetris.org/)

Mom look at me I'm building a computer!

## Don't cheat!
As stated in http://www.nand2tetris.org/terms.php, students applying to this course are strongly encouraged to write their own solutions. I recommend you follow such guidelines, and just look at my code *after* you have done your version of it. Furthermore, I'm using this repository as an easy way to work in the same codebase from different places.
